    ASSIGNMENT!!! TO BE SUBMITTED BY 8PM TODAY!!

Create a multidimensional array of Students containing the following data 
for each student:

Student name, score, subject, term(e.g 1st term). 

1. Calculate the average score for each student(1st,2nd & 3rd position)

2. Calculate the percentage of each student score. If any student score is
 above 75% recommend the student for a government scholarship

ELSE

If any student score is below 40% ask the student to REPEAT the class.

Sample:  students = [
    ["Miracle", 80, "physics",3],    ["bolanle", 60, "maths",2]
]

// formula solving: (score/100) +%+ -->

 //we will loop through the students data to get what we need to work with

    //ANSWER TO QUESTION 2: a&b


 //the formula to get the percentage will be (score/20*100) +%+



 //this is to execute this function for each array

///the solving formula in use here

            2,0,percentage 
            //to output the nums concatenated with this symbol
